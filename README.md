# Library Book Management

The provided JavaScript code represents a simple library book management system.

The code includes a "Book" constructor function that creates book objects with properties for title, author, pages, and read status.

Other functions are defined to add books to the library, remove books from the library, and display all the books in the library. The displayBooks() function dynamically generates HTML elements to represent each book, including its title, author, pages, and read status.

Event listeners are implemented to interact with the system, such as adding a new book through a form, toggling the read status of a book, and canceling book addition.

Although the HTML code is not provided, the JavaScript functions can be integrated into an HTML document to create a user interface for managing a library of books. HTML elements, such as buttons and forms, can be added to trigger the corresponding JavaScript functions.

This code provides a foundation for implementing a library book management system and can be customized and expanded to suit specific requirements and design preferences within an HTML environment.
